* Fri Oct 17 2014 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.1.0-2
- CVE-2014-3566: Updated cipher suites to help mitigate POODLE.

- The tls_cipher_suite variable is set to HIGH:-SSLv2 because OpenLDAP
  cannot set the SSL provider natively. By default, it will run TLSv1
  but cannot handle TLSv1.2 therefore the SSLv3 ciphers cannot be
  eliminated. Take care to ensure that your clients only connect with
  TLSv1 if possible.
