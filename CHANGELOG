* Tue Nov 09 2021 Steven Pritchard <steve@sicura.us> - 7.3.0

  resources (to allow for managing domains via hiera)

* Fri Aug 27 2021 Henry Pauli <henry+spam@mixict.nl> - 7.2.0
- Add an option in sssd::install to not install sssd client.

  where the ssssd-client package may not exists.

* Thu Aug 05 2021 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 7.1.1
- Add an override for sssd-sudo.service to start it as root:root. This aligns
  with how sssd itself would start the service and the daemon cannot access
  /var/lib/sss/db/config.ldb otherwise.

* Thu Jun 17 2021 Chris Tessmer <chris.tessmer@onyxpoint.com> - 7.1.0
- Removed support for Puppet 5

  defined.  The enable_files_domain setting is set to true to ensure
  that sssd will start.

  - `sssd::provider::ldap::ldap_pwd_policy` is based on the value in
    `ldap_account_expire_policy` to properly account for non-shadow systems
  - `sssd::provider::ldap::ldap_access_order` is set to the modern set
  - A typo in the `sssd::LdapAccountExpirePol` data type was fixed
  - Ported the krb5 ERB template to EPP and fixed a typo
- Removed:
  - `sssd::manage_service` - obsolete
  - `sssd::ldap_access_order_defaults()` - obsolelte
  - Removed EL6-only artifacts
  - Removed the `LOCAL` domain
  - Support for Puppet 5 was dropped
- Changed:
  - Fail if a version of `sssd` is being managed < 1.16.0
  - Now use the `/etc/sssd/conf.d` directory instead of `concat`
  - The `sssd::service` class is now private
  - Moved the `/etc/sssd` directory configuration into `sssd::config`
- Added:
  - `sssd::config::entry` defined type which allows consistent management of
    permissions and dependencies on config files
  - Users can set `sssd::custom_config` to a `String` that will be placed into
    `/etc/sssd/conf.d/zz_puppet_custom.conf`
  - Allow users to optionally purge the `/etc/sssd/conf.d` directory (disabled
    by default)
  - Trigger the `sssd-sudo.socket` service instead of including the service in
    the main configuration per the `sssd` documentation and error messages in
    the logs
  - Support for puppetlabs/stdlib 7 was added

  their platform
- Migrate the documentation to focus on the 'files' provider since 'local' is
  not recommended to be used any longer
- Fixed the core acceptance tests

* Tue Jan 21 2020 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> - 6.3.0-0
- Added EL8 support
- Removed requirement for sssd domain entry for el8 and SSSD V2 since
  using the implicit files provider is valid and even recommended
  for performance by some.  An sssd domain is still required for
  el6 and el7.
- Automatically include the service section if the service is included in
  sssd::services.
- Removed deprecated variables from ldap provider for EL8.
- Added new variables for providers in EL8.

  lockouts on upgrade.

* Mon Jan 21 2019 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 6.1.4-0
- Generated a REFERENCE.md
- Set the 'min_id' settings across the board to '1' to match the sssd defaults
  since they really have nothing to do with the target system's relationship
  with a centralized authentication service.
- Update the sssd::provider::ldap::ldap_access_order parameter to support the
  ppolicy related options that were added in sssd 1.14.0
  - ppolicy
  - pwd_expire_policy_reject
  - pwd_expire_policy_warn
  - pwd_expire_policy_renew

* Fri Oct 12 2018 Nick Miller <nick.miller@onyxpoint.com> - 6.1.3-0

- Added OracleLinux to operating system check for 128 bit cipher
  work-around

* Tue Aug 28 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 6.1.3-0
- Fixed a bug in which the ldap_account_expire_policy setting
  for the LDAP provider could not be configured to use the system
  default. Now, when sssd::provider::ldap::ldap_account_expire_policy
  is set to '', that configuration parameter will not be written
  to the sssd configuration file. This allows the system default to
  be applied.
- Fixed a bug in which any boolean setting for the LDAP provider
  configuration could not be configured to be 'false'.
- Fixed bugs in which sssd::provider::ldap::debug_timestamps and
  sssd::provider::ldap::ldap_search_timeout were erroneously typed to
  be strings, instead of a Boolean and an Integer, respectively.
- Fixed bugs in which ad_enable_dns_sites, ad_enable_gc settings,
  dyndns_update, dyndns_update_ptr, krb5_use_enterprise_principal,
  and ldap_idmap_autorid_compat settings for the AD provider could
  not be configured to be 'false'.
- Fixed bugs in which ad_gpo_map_interactive, ad_gpo_map_remote_interactive,
  ad_gpo_map_network, ad_gpo_map_batch, ad_gpo_map_service, ad_gpo_map_permit
  and ad_gpo_map_deny settings for the AD provider were incorrectly formatted.
- Fixed a bug in which the dyndns_iface setting for the AD provider was not
  set from sssd::provider::ad::dyndns_ifaces.

  `ldap_chpass_update_last_change`. These were consolidated into a correct
  single `ldap_chpass_update_last_change` Boolean.
- Removed RPM dependencies on 'simp-boostrap' and 'puppet' since these are

- CVE-2014-3566: Updated cipher suites to help mitigate POODLE.

- The tls_cipher_suite variable is set to HIGH:-SSLv2 because OpenLDAP
  cannot set the SSL provider natively. By default, it will run TLSv1
  but cannot handle TLSv1.2 therefore the SSLv3 ciphers cannot be
  eliminated. Take care to ensure that your clients only connect with
  TLSv1 if possible.
